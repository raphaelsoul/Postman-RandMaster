Randmaster------RandSeeder Script for POSTMAN
===============

> Just some tiny works. ------ the famous elder.

Currently there's only 6 random methods. But it can alreay fill the most test workd during the development.

* randInt: function (max, min=0) 
* randNumString: function (length, radix=10)------the return string can have zero as the first letter. 
* randDecimal: function (precision, digit)
* randString: function(length, hasNumber=true, hasSymbol=true) ----you can disable some elements
* randChinaMobile: function()
* randUuid: function(version=4) ---- not safe Uuid v4, but already enough for testing.
